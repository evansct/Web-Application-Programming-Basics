        <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>An important factor that appears to affect conditions within a distributed collaboration setting is group cohesion. Previous research has found that communication technology often de-lays the development of the group cohesion construct in virtual teams. As a result, global teams tend to have much lower group cohesion levels than co-located groups. One of the reasons that it is important to examine group cohesion levels in groups is that research has shown that this construct seems to affect how a team deals with different obstacles during the development of a project. In addition, the relation between group cohesion and other constructs (e.g. trust) has been shown to have a significant relationship to team performance.</p>
        <p>There have been a number of different approaches used to measure group cohesiveness; everything from the use of paper-based individual surveys to the more automatic process of following a team’s communication trails. All of these methods have shown the significance of looking at factors that affect the cohesion construct at the team process level. While these studies are certainly useful, they fail to capture the temporal aspects of the group processes and how they relate to task cohesion. A failure to utilize temporal information naturally reduces the power of the analysis, which may, in turn, limit the validity of a study’s conclusions. In an effort to better understand the temporal factors and their effect on task cohesion, we introduce a number of temporal variables that can be used to predict a groups overall task cohesion levels. In particular, we focus on the analysis of the temporal features of pacing rate, pacing similarity, and synchrony within medium-sized global software development teams and show how these features can be used to predict the cohesion levels within a group.</p>
        <p>The goal of this paper, therefore, is to examine the temporal features of global virtual teams and determine whether these measures relate to task cohesion. These measures will also be used to help validate an overall model that predicts task cohesion. The general hypothesis in this paper is that the communication activities that occur within distributed teams are cyclical in nature and oscillate between discussions and individual work. A better understanding of these temporal factors and how they relate to cohesion levels within a group should add to our understanding of group work.</p>
