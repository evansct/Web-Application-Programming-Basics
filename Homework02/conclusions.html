        <h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>The major goal of this study was to determine which temporal features can predict <em>Task Cohesion</em> for individuals and teams who were engaged in global software development projects. The motivation for this work was the expectation that information about the cohesion levels among individuals and teams in global software development projects could lead to better interactions among team members, and ultimately better group performance. Although many researchers have explored relationships between certain collaboration variables <a href="references.html#ref4">[4]</a>, <a href="references.html#ref5">[5]</a>, <a href="references.html#ref6">[6]</a>, few have examined the effects of temporal factors of pacing and synchrony. For example, previous research has in-dicated that certain linguistic similarity, information exchange, and message content can help determine cohesion levels within groups <a href="references.html#ref7">[7]</a>, <a href="references.html#ref8">[8]</a>, <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>. However, we felt that just-in-time and abrupt communications require new methodologies to measure temporal phenomena that are more complex than simple linear patterns. For example, current research has not captured the effects of communication cycles spiraling up, down or intensifying. Thus this work herein proposes a methodology for describing the temporal narratives of distributed team processes over time and determining whether they could be used to predict Task cohesion. The three measures that were developed for this study were Pacing similarity, Pacing rate, and Synchrony. Each of these factors was examined at both the individual and group level.</p>
        <p>Results showed a statistically significant negative correlation between the Pacing rate and Task cohesion, which suggests that frequent and perhaps sporadic rhythmic communications about different social and work themes increases the cohesion among team members. On the other hand, Pacing similarity was not found to be related to Task cohesion, which suggests that a minimum (although not equal) participation is necessary for individuals to perceive that their group is cohesive. Thus, Pacing similarity is not relevant to Task cohesion. We also found a positive correlation between Synchrony and Task co-hesion, which suggests the importance of establishing a rhythm within a team. Finally, the temporal models constructed at individual and group-levels were found to be good predictors of Task cohesion, which indicates the existence of a strong effect of frequent and rhythmic communications on cohesion related to the task.</p>
        <p>Knowledge obtained from this study should provide insight into current empirical research on global virtual teams by defining the different temporal patterns that occur in these projects and how this can affect a teamâ€™s perception of their cohesion levels.</p>
