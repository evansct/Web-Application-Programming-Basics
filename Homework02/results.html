        <p>The data, collected from the three global projects, was then used to determine which set of variables were most successful at predicting individual Task cohesion.</p>
        <h3 id="sampleCharacteristics"><em>A. Sample Characteristics</em></h3>
        <p>A total of 5583 messages were transmitted during the three projects. A total of 167, out of a possible 180, Task cohesion surveys were collected. Since we had 27 missing surveys, we reduced the data set to include only those messages sent by students who had completed the questionnaire; thus, we had a total of 5446 messages in the final data set.</p>
        <h3 id="cultureEffect"><em>B. The Culture Effect</em></h3>
        <p>We received cohesion surveys from people who were born in eleven different countries. However, the majority of the completed surveys came from students born in India, the US, and Mexico (i.e <em>n</em> &gt; 20), while only a few surveys came from students born in other countries (i.e. <em>n</em> &lt; 4). As a result, we reduced the data set even further by using data from only students born in India, the US, and Mexico; thus, ending up with a final count of 4849 messages sent by 153 individuals. We then compared the Task cohesion mean values between countries and found that students from India tended to have higher Task cohesion perceptions than either US or Mexican students (see Table I). As a result, we used the Culture factor as a control variable in our analyses.</p>

        <p>As indicated in Table II, in the column labeled ”Instances used,” some of the participants were removed from this set of data. Students who posted only one message were not included in the data for this category because the pacing similarity measure cannot be calculated in cases where there is only a single instance. Thus, students who transmitted only one communication were eliminated from the computations for the pacing variable.</p>
        <p>Data analyzed for the remaining subjects appears to indicate that Pacing similarity has a similar value across all three projects; however, a comparison of the Pacing rate shows that the communication rhythms within the three projects were dissimilar. More specifically, the rate of student replies was much slower in the last project.</p>

        <h3 id="temporalMeasures"><em>D. Temporal measures and Task cohesion</em></h3>
        <p>Using the final data set, we calculated the correlation between Pacing similarity and Task Cohesion and between Pacing rate and Task cohesion at the Individual-level.</p>
        <p>Table III shows that Pacing similarity has no effect on Task cohesion. On the other hand, Pacing rate has a weak, but statistically significant effect on Task Cohesion. This correlation, albeit weak, suggests that frequent communication tends to lead to an increase in an individual’s perception of Task cohesion, possibly because the more that team members discuss information about either social or work activities, the more team members trust one another and have positive feelings towards one another. The lack of a relation between Pacing similarity and Task cohesion suggests that individuals prefer frequent, although erratic, communication (Pacing rate) with team members, over a more uniform, but less frequent, rate of communication.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Pacing rate metric consists of 2 components: 1) Duration of communication (time between first and last communications), and 2) Number of communications. As a result, we analyzed the relation of these two components to Task cohesion. Table IV shows that both components have a statistically significant relation to Task cohesion. The relation of the Number and Duration of communications to Task cohesion may represent the communication engagement by each participant. Therefore, participants who are engaged in the project will perceive a greater team cohesion than those who are not.</p>
        <p>In addition to our pacing measures, we calculated the tem-poral variable of Synchrony for team members. The results of this analysis, as presented in Table V, suggests that Synchrony is a very good predictor of Task cohesion. Therefore, this metric seems to capture the synchrony of collaborations among team members, regardless of the frequency of when those communications occur (e.g. communications every 12 hours, versus communications every 24 hours, etc).</p>
        <p>A model using the Pacing rate (pr) and Synchrony (sy) (while controlled by Team size (ts) and Culture (cu)) was created to predict Task cohesion (coh). The top row in Table VI shows that the temporal model is a good predictor of the variability of the Task cohesion variable (r=0.358). Thus, our model indicates that temporal-based measures at the individual-level are helpful for understanding the perceptions of Task cohesiveness.</p>
        <p>We also tested the prediction power of these measures at the Group-level by using Team size (ts), Group pacing rate (gpr), Group synchrony (gsy) and Group Task cohesion (gcoh). Results shown in the last row of Table VI indicate that Group-level temporal measures are also good predictors of Task cohesion.</p>
